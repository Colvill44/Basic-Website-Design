	<h1>Project Proposal:</p>
	
	<p>For this project I will be using an outside of the class client
	from a game that I play during my free time. In this game I am part of
	an elite group of gamers who spend their time completing tasks at a world record
	setting pace. I will design a website where they can upload their achievements
	and take applications for new members. It will also give news updates and calendar
	events for upcoming activities and requirements of its members. We will observe a home page
	that guides us to each of these four sections and then appropriately fill the data and take 
	forms for new applications that people with access can see.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h2>Home Page:</h2>
	
	<p>The home page will be pretty obvious. It will show recent events and help navigate to the 
	correct page of the site you are looking for.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h2>News Page:</h2>
	
	<p>The news page will display news for upcoming things such as game updates and other important
	noteworthy news that applies to the guild members</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h2>Calendar Page:</h2>
	
	<p>The calendar page will be an active calendar displaying upcoming events and other important
	dates to those who are active members of the guild</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h2>Achievements Page:</h2>
	
	<p>The achievements page will hold information on past accomplishments and feats overcome by 
	the guild and will provide credentials for those interested in learning about or joining the 
	team.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h2>Application Page:</h2>
	
	<p>The application page will be a form for those interested in joining so that officers of the
	guild can recieve email updates on new applicants. It will take in name and experience so that
	the officers can appropriately weed through each application in a clean and quick way.</p>
