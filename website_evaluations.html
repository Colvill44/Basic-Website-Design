			<h3>Bad Website: <a href="http://thebiguglywebsite.com/">The Big Ugly Website</a></h3>
			
			<p>This website was specifically designed to pretty much break every rule of the CRAP design principles. 
			Overall this may be the worst website ever created, as far as design is concerned.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Contrast: The color pairings and text boxes are extremely difficult to read between the poor
				 choices in color and the terrible opacity percentages.</li>
				<li>Repitition: There is no transcending theme what so ever in this website and each section
				 has an extremely drastic change in style.</li>
				<li>Alignment: It does not seem to follow any grid consistencies nor does any of the information
				 feel like it is flowing in any particular direction.</li>
				<li>Proximity: Each element feels clustered and just thrown to the wolves wherever the website
				 automatically put each element.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Good Website: <a href="https://activetheory.net/home">Active Theory</a></h3>
			
			<p>This website may be beyond most websites today in creativity. While it is extremely futuristic,
			 it holds very true to the CRAP fundamental guidelines for what makes a well designed webpage.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Contrast: While alot of the room for color is replaced by 3d imaging the text and menu
				 panels follow good color choices to remain clearly visible to the user in the forefront
				  of the graphics.</li>
				<li>Repitition: As you navigate through the menu the theme is consistent and seem to follow
				 the same trend between each page.</li>
				<li>Alignment: The alignment of the pages is consistent as you move through the different
				 features of the website.</li>
				<li>Proximity: The spacing and placement of the elements is neat and clean making each element
				 easy to find and interact with.</li>
			</ul>
